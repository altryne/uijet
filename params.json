The rest of the modules are optional.\r\n\r\n### Without AMD\r\n\r\nInclude the libraries you are using with the modules (e.g. jQuery if using the dom/jquery module).\r\nInclude uijet.js followed by widgets/Base.js and the rest of the widgets you need afterwards.\r\nIf you require any mixins (or if they're required by any of the widgets you're using) include them after the widgets.\r\nIf you require any adapters include those too after the mixins along with each library they adapt to.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation notes\r\n\r\nUIjet makes only one layer in the application and depends on other integral components\r\nthat should reside within the application:\r\n\r\n* Custom events/Messaging library\r\n* Promises API library\r\n* DOM wrapper library\r\n* [optional] XMLHttpRequest/XHR2/CORS wrapper library\r\n* [optional] Template engine\r\n* [optional] URL router\r\n\r\n__Note__: UIjet is not directly dependent on any other 3rd party code but also does not attempts to do anything that\r\nothers already do, and do it well. On the other hand, UIjet defines simple methods and conventions for hooking up any\r\n3rd party library you need into it.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Custom events library of choice\r\n* Promises API library of choice\r\n* DOM API wrapping library of choice\r\n* [optional] XHR wrapping library of choice\r\n* [optional] Template engine of choice\r\n* [optoinal] URL router of choice\r\n* [optional] require.js\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Application startup\r\n\r\n    //TBD\r\n\r\n### Widget instances definition\r\n\r\n    //TBD\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nYehonatan Daniv\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n\r\nVenvid Technologies","google":""}
